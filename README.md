# How to Run

This Project uses Cocoapods. However, all of the dependencies are included in this repository, so you should not need
it installed in order to run it.

To Run the Project, open the `SirWellingtonMall.xcworkspace` file using the latest version of XCode.

# How it works

Depending on a Random assignment, the App will open with either an empty list, or a populated list. Relaunch it a couple of times to see.

## Deleting an item
To Delete an item from the list, simply swipe to the left.

## Checking/Unchecking an item
To Check/Uncheck an item in your list, swipe it to the right. This will toggle its
state.

## Adding Items to the List
To add items to your Grocery List, simply click the `+` icon on the top-right,
and then select the Product you want to add.

## Adding Custom Products
To add a custom product, hit the `+` button from the Grocery List,
and then hit the `+` button again on the top-right to add a custom product.

Follow the guide to add your very own **SW** Merchandise ðŸ˜Ž.


# Caveats

+ This App was tested and designed on an iPhone 6, so it may look sub-optimal on other devices.

+ Due to time constraints, this App does not persist, and so the Application state  resets every time the App Launches.

+ Because Products and Images are stored in-memory, if you add too many items and products in the App, it will
eventually run out of memory.
